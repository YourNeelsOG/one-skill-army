description: "Find the mistakes agents keep repeating in this repo and make each one impossible. Try architecture first, then types, then a lint whose error names the fix, then a test, and write docs last. Prove each check fails on a real past mistake. Repeat this each time the operator corrects you. Use for /correct."

Read the installed [correct skill](../skills/correct/SKILL.md) in full,
then apply its workflow to `$ARGUMENTS`. Resolve references relative to that
skill directory, including when installed outside this checkout.

OSA rules take precedence: approved design before implementation, mandatory
TDD, structural comments, and explicit per-action authorization for Git and
external writes. Use only available host tools and models. If the skill cannot
be found, report the missing installation rather than inventing its workflow.
