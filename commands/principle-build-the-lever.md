description: "Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun."
---

Read the installed [principle-build-the-lever skill](../skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) in full,
then apply its workflow to `$ARGUMENTS`. Resolve references relative to that
skill directory, including when installed outside this checkout.

OSA rules take precedence: approved design before implementation, mandatory
TDD, structural comments, and explicit per-action authorization for Git and
external writes. Use only available host tools and models. If the skill cannot
be found, report the missing installation rather than inventing its workflow.
