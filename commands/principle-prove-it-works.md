description: "Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles.'"

Read the installed [principle-prove-it-works skill](../skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) in full,
then apply its workflow to `$ARGUMENTS`. Resolve references relative to that
skill directory, including when installed outside this checkout.

OSA rules take precedence: approved design before implementation, mandatory
TDD, structural comments, and explicit per-action authorization for Git and
external writes. Use only available host tools and models. If the skill cannot
be found, report the missing installation rather than inventing its workflow.
