# Swarm


## OSA execution contract

Read [portable runtime and policy](../poteto-mode/references/runtime.md) before acting.
Reuse it once per task unless it changes or context is compacted.

Fan out N independently scoped workers through actual available host tools. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the cloud concurrency limit.
4. Resolve the validated `swarm workers` role from `.osa/poteto-models.json`, defaulting to inherit. Use only detected model identifiers and supported parameters. For a model race, name each available arm up front; on fallback, record that it is no longer a diverse-model race.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Launch workers only through the host-supported delegation tool with supported parameters. Bound in-flight work to actual slots. Prefer local isolated worktrees; use cloud workers only when capability and authorization exist. When delegation is absent or prohibited, execute roles serially with the same briefs and report the independence limitation.

When a remote worker needs a specific revision, use only supported branch/revision parameters and verify its actual checkout. Do not publish a branch solely to satisfy a guessed cloud API.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
